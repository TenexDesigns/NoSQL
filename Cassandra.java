Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed NoSQL database that was originally developed by Facebook. It was designed to handle large volumes of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It is capable of dealing with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and is well-suited for use cases that require high performance and scalability [Source 25](https://www.datastax.com/guides/apache-cassandra-introduction-comparison).

Here are some key features of Cassandra:

1. **Distributed**: Every node in the cluster has the same role. There is no single point of failure and data is distributed across the cluster (even across multiple data centers).

2. **Scalability**: Cassandra is designed to handle big data. Its distributed architecture allows for easy data scale-out and high-velocity write capabilities.

3. **High Performance**: Cassandra provides high-speed read and write operations. It also provides tunable consistency - the number of nodes that must acknowledge a read or write operation can be specified.

4. **Flexible Data Storage**: Cassandra can accommodate all possible data formats including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. It can dynamically accommodate changes to your data structures according to your needs.

5. **Fault Tolerant**: Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance. Replication across multiple data centers is also supported [Source 16](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/features-of-cassandra/), [Source 22](https://www.openlogic.com/blog/apache-cassandra-overview).

Cassandra can be used in applications where high-speed reads and writes are required, and the data is distributed across multiple locations. Some typical use cases for Cassandra include:

- **Messaging Systems**: Cassandra can handle heavy write loads and deliver messages reliably.

- **Recommendation and Personalization Engines**: Cassandra's ability to handle large volumes of data and provide high-speed reads and writes makes it suitable for real-time recommendation engines.

- **Fraud Detection**: Cassandra can process large volumes of data in real time, making it suitable for fraud detection systems.

- **Time-series Data**: Cassandra's data model is well-suited for time-series data like IoT sensor data or stock price data.

- **Product Catalogs and Playlists**: Cassandra can store and manage distributed data, making it suitable for product catalogs in e-commerce applications or playlists in music streaming applications [Source 12](https://medium.com/geekculture/system-design-solutions-when-to-use-cassandra-and-when-not-to-496ba51ef07a).
