NoSQL databases come in various types, each designed to handle specific data storage and retrieval needs. Here are some common types of NoSQL databases along with examples:

1. **Document Stores:**
   - **Characteristics:** Store data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
   - **Examples:**
     - MongoDB: A popular and widely used document-oriented database.
     - CouchDB: A database that uses JSON for documents, JavaScript for MapReduce queries.

2. **Key-Value Stores:**
   - **Characteristics:** Simplest form of NoSQL database, where data is stored as key-value pairs.
   - **Examples:**
     - Redis: In-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
     - DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS.

3. **Wide-Column Stores:**
   - **Characteristics:** Stores data tables as columns rather than rows.
   - **Examples:**
     - Apache Cassandra: Highly scalable and distributed database designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
     - HBase: Distributed, scalable, and big data store modeled after Google Bigtable.

4. **Graph Databases:**
   - **Characteristics:** Optimized for representing and traversing relationships between data.
   - **Examples:**
     - Neo4j: Graph database management system known for its expressive query language.
     - Amazon Neptune: Fully managed graph database service provided by AWS.

5. **Time-Series Databases:**
   - **Characteristics:** Optimized for handling time-series data, such as logs, metrics, and events.
   - **Examples:**
     - InfluxDB: Open-source time-series database.
     - Prometheus: Monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for time-series data.

6. **Object-Oriented Databases:**
   - **Characteristics:** Stores data as objects, similar to how they are represented in object-oriented programming languages.
   - **Examples:**
     - db4o: Open-source object-oriented database management system.
     - ObjectDB: Object-oriented database management system for Java.

7. **XML Databases:**
   - **Characteristics:** Designed to store and query XML data.
   - **Examples:**
     - BaseX: Native XML database management system.
     - eXist-db: Open-source XML database.

It's important to note that these categories can sometimes overlap, and databases may offer features that span multiple types. The choice of a NoSQL database depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as the nature of the data, scalability needs, and query patterns.
