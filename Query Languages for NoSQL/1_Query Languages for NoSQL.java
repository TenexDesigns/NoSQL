Yes, NoSQL databases do have their own query languages, but they differ from SQL and from each other, depending on the type of NoSQL database. 

For instance:

- **MongoDB** uses a document-oriented query language that's similar to JSON. You can perform operations like find, insert, update, and delete. Here's an example of a MongoDB query:

```javascript
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb", function(err, db) {
  if (err) throw err;
  db.collection("customers").find({}).toArray(function(err, result) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(result);
    db.close();
  });
});
```

- **Cassandra** uses the Cassandra Query Language (CQL), which is similar to SQL. Here's an example of a CQL query:

```cql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE lastname='Doe';
```

- **Redis** doesn't have a query language like SQL. Instead, you interact with the database using a set of commands. Here's an example of a Redis command:

```bash
SET mykey "Hello"
```

- **CouchDB** uses MapReduce functions for querying the database. Here's an example of a CouchDB MapReduce function:

```javascript
function(doc) {
  emit(doc._id, doc);
}
```

While NoSQL databases have their own query languages, they're different from SQL and from each other, and they may not support all the features of SQL, such as joins. However, they offer other features, like horizontal scaling and handling of unstructured data, that make them a good choice for certain types of applications [Source 0](https://www.coursera.org/articles/nosql-vs-sql), [Source 1](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql), [Source 3](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/sql-vs-nosql.html), [Source 4](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained), [Source 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL), [Source 9](https://www.oracle.com/database/nosql/what-is-nosql/).
